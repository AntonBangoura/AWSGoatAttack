# Attacking AwsGoat infrastructure with tools.

## Each file documents one step of the pentesting
### Within each file, a file documents the use of a specific tool


#### I will conduct my pentest in such steps: 
1. Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target website and its associated AWS infrastructure, including IP addresses, domain names, and any subdomains.

2. Vulnerability scanning: Use automated tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the website and its associated AWS resources.

3. Exploitation: Attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities identified during the vulnerability scan to gain access to the website and its associated AWS resources.

4. Privilege escalation: Once access is gained, attempt to escalate privileges to gain administrative access to the website and its associated AWS resources.

5. Maintaining access: Attempt to maintain access to the website and its associated AWS resources, including by implementing persistence mechanisms such as backdoors or scheduled tasks.

6. Lateral movement: Attempt to move laterally within the AWS infrastructure to gain access to other resources.

7. Data exfiltration: Attempt to exfiltrate sensitive data from the website and its associated AWS resources.

8. Reporting: Document all findings and provide a detailed report of the vulnerabilities identified, the methods used to exploit them, and the data exfiltrated.

9. Remediation: Work with the client to implement remediation strategies to address the vulnerabilities identified.

Those operations are allowed for aws ressource:
    Port scanning
    Vulnerability scanning or checks
    Web application scanning
    Exploitation
    Forgery
    Injections
    Fuzzing
